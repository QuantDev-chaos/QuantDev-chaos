### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Hector from Chicago and recently joined GitHub. My background is in Mechanical Engineering which means that I prefered to work with a pencil, a piece of paper and my pocket calculator. That also means that I started a bit late to work on programming. Although GitHub seemed overwhelming at first, I am still here mostly trying to catch up. So I decided to focus on Python and have been working on learning the language, and practicing a ton of exercises from matplotlib, NumPy, QuantEcon, Pandas, and exercises from books from PacktPublishing.
However, I would really like to learn how to contribute to a project or get technical training, or better yet get a job at GitHub or NumFOCUS, or Canonical. That would be great. In the meantime, I would like to thank everyone that contributes to Open-Source organizations. You are the reason why I have access to this education. Thank you!
